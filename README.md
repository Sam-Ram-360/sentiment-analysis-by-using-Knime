# sentiment-analysis-by-using-Knime

In this project, I focused on performing sentiment analysis on Yelp restaurant reviews. To begin, I uploaded the Yelp review file, which served as the basis for my analysis.

To prepare the textual data for analysis, I applied various preprocessing steps using different nodes in Knime. These included utilizing the Stanford lemmatizer, word creator, Stanford tagger, and punctuation Erasure. These nodes helped transform the raw text into a structured format suitable for further analysis.

After preprocessing, I identified the 10 most frequent features in the reviews. This provided valuable insights into the commonly mentioned aspects of the restaurants and their associated sentiments.

Next, I applied classification algorithms, including SVM, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, to predict the sentiment of the reviews. Evaluating the performance of these algorithms, I plotted the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to assess the models' accuracy and compare their effectiveness.

To gain deeper insights into the data, I performed topic detection. This analysis helped uncover the underlying themes or topics discussed in the Yelp reviews. By identifying these topics, I was able to provide a descriptive understanding of the main subjects and sentiments expressed by the reviewers.

If you have any further questions or need additional details, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist you.
